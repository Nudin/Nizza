abstract = {We present a deep optical survey of Uranus' Hill sphere for small satellites. The Subaru 8-m telescope was used to survey about 3.5 square degrees with a 50\% detection efficiency at limiting red magnitude m = 26.1 mag. This magnitude corresponds to objects that are about 7 km in radius (assuming an albedo of 0.04). We detected (without prior knowledge of their positions) all previously known outer satellites and discovered two new irregular satellites (S/2001 U2 and S/2003 U3). The two inner satellites Titania and Oberon were also detected. One of the newly discovered satellites (S/2003 U3) is the first known irregular prograde of the planet. The population, size distribution and orbital parameters of Uranus' irregular satellites are remarkably similar to the irregular satellites of gas giant Jupiter. Both have shallow size distributions (power law indices q\~{}2 for radii > 7 km) with no correlation between the sizes of the satellites and their orbital parameters. However, unlike those of Jupiter, Uranus' irregular satellites do not appear to occupy tight distinct dynamical groups in semi-major axis versus inclination phase space. Two groupings in semi-major axis versus eccentricity phase space appear to be statistically significant.},

abstract = {Discovery of trans-neptunian object (TNO) satellites and determination of their orbits has recently enabled estimation of the size and albedo of several small TNOs, extending the size range of objects having known size and albedo down into the sub-100 km range. In this paper we compute albedo and size estimates or limits for 20 TNOs, using a consistent method for all binary objects and a consistent method for all objects having reported thermal fluxes. As is true for larger TNOs, the small objects show a remarkable diversity of albedos. Although the sample is limited, there do not yet appear to be any trends relating albedo to other observable properties or to dynamical class, with the possible exception of inclination. The observed albedo diversity of TNOs has important implications for computing the size-frequency distribution, the mass, and other global properties of the Kuiper belt derived from observations of objects' apparent magnitudes and may also point the way toward an improved compositional taxonomy based on albedo in addition to color. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The existence of extremely wide binaries in the low-inclination component of the Kuiper Belt pro- vides a unique handle on the dynamical history of this population. Some popular frameworks of the formation of the Kuiper Belt suggest that planetesimals were moved there from lower semi-major axis orbits by scattering encounters with Neptune. We test the effects such events would have on binary systems, and find that wide binaries are efficiently destroyed by the kinds of scattering events required to create the Kuiper Belt with this mechanism. This indicates that a binary-bearing component of the cold Kuiper Belt was emplaced through a gentler mechanism or was formed in situ.},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for long-term planetary orbit integrations, including the dominant post-Newtonian effects, that employs individual time steps for each planet. The algorithm is symplectic and exhibits short-term errors that are O(epsilon(Omega2)(tau 2) where tau is the time step, Omega is a typical orbital frequency, and epsilon much less than 1 is a typical planetary mass in solar units. By a special starting procedure long-term errors over an integration interval T can be reduced to O(epsilon2(Omega3)(tau2)T. A sample 0.8 Myr integration of the nine planets illustrates that Pluto can have a time step more than 100 times Mercury's, without dominating the positional error. Our algorithm is applicable to other N-body systems.},

abstract = {We have measured broadband optical BVR photometry of 24 classical and scattered Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), approximately doubling the published sample of colors for these classes of objects. We find a statistically significant correlation between object color and inclination in the classical Kuiper belt using our data. The color and inclination correlation increases in significance after the inclusion of additional data points culled from all published works. Apparently, this color and inclination correlation has not been more widely reported because the Plutinos show no such correlation and thus have been a major contaminant in previous samples. The color and inclination correlation excludes simple origins of color diversity, such as the presence of a coloring agent without regard to dynamical effects. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of the Kuiper belt precludes us from understanding whether the color and inclination trend is due to environmental factors, such as collisional resurfacing, or primordial population effects. A perihelion and color correlation is also evident, although this appears to be a spurious correlation induced by sampling bias, as perihelion and inclination are correlated in the observed sample of KBOs.},

abstract = {We investigate the hypothesis that the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) of the Moon was triggered by the formation of Uranus and Neptune. As Uranus and Neptune formed, which we assume occurred at the epoch of the LHB, they scattered neighboring icy planetesimals throughout the Solar System. Some of these objects hit the Moon. Our integrations show that the Moon would have accreted about 6×1021 g, if we assume that the Uranus–Neptune region initially contained 5 times the current mass of these planets in the form of small solid objects. In addition, Mars would have accumulated ∼6×1022 g of icy material, which could have supplied its putative early massive atmosphere. However, Earth would likely have accreted only ∼7×1022 g of water, or ∼5\% of its oceans, through the mechanisms studied here. The numerical experiment that we have performed on the behavior of Uranus–Neptune planetesimals shows very good agreement with current constraints on the LHB. The influx of Uranus–Neptune planetesimals onto the Moon could have lasted for a time as short as 10 or 20 million years. The dynamical transport of the Uranus–Neptune planetesimals during this process would have caused Jupiter and Saturn to migrate. This migration, in turn, would have destabilized objects in the jovian Trojan swarms and the asteroid belt. Thus, not only would Uranus and Neptune planetesimals have struck the Moon, but asteroids would have as well. We find that the Trojan asteroids of Jupiter could not have contributed a large percentage of material to the LHB, but the asteroid belt could, in principle, have contributed to, or even dominated, the LHB. Although this model appears to explain the LHB well, it requires that fully formed Uranus and Neptune not appear in the trans-saturnian region until some 700 million years after the formation of the Earth.},

@article{Nesvorny2012,
abstract = {Several properties of the Solar System, including the wide radial spacing and orbital eccentricities of giant planets, can be explained if the early Solar System evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planets in the planetesimal disk. Here we report the results of a statistical study, in which we performed nearly 10\^{}4 numerical simulations of planetary instability starting from hundreds of different initial conditions. We found that the dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the Solar System. Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk of planetesimals was large (M\_disk>50 M\_Earth), but we found that a massive disk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e\_55 < 0.01 compared to present e\_55=0.044, where e\_55 is the amplitude of the fifth eccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates constraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were obtained when the Solar System was assumed to have five giant planets initially and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected into interstellar space by Jupiter. The best results were obtained when the ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance with Saturn and M\_disk \~{} 20 M\_Earth. The range of possible outcomes is rather broad in this case, indicating that the present Solar System is neither a typical nor expected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with only a \~{}5\% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the main text). The case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but does offer significant advantages relative to the five planet case.},

The new LROC image data show that the Sculptured Hills in the Taurus highlands is Imbrium ejecta and not directly related to the formation of the Serenitatis basin. This occurrence and the geological relations of this unit suggests that the Apollo 17 impact melts may not be not samples of the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, leaving their provenance undetermined and origin unexplained. If the Apollo 17 melt rocks are Serenitatis impact melt, up to half of the basin and large crater population of the Moon was created within a 30 Ma interval around 3.8 Ga in a global impact “cataclysm.” Either interpretation significantly changes our view of the impact process and history of the Earth-Moon system.},

@article{Levison2011,
abstract = {We revisit the issue of the cause of the dynamical instability during the so-called Nice model, which describes the early dynamical evolution of the giant planets. In particular, we address the problem of the interaction of planets with a distant planetesimal disk in the time interval between the dispersal of the proto-solar nebula and the instability. In contrast to previous works, we assume that the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is several AUs beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, so that no close encounters between planets and planetesimals occur. Moreover, we model the disk's viscous stirring, induced by the presence of embedded Pluto-sized objects. The four outer planets are assumed to be initially locked in a multi-resonant state that most likely resulted from a preceding phase of gas-driven migration. We show that viscous stirring leads to an irreversible exchange of energy between a planet and a planetesimal disk even in the absence of close encounters between the planet and disk particles. The process is mainly driven by the most eccentric planet, which is the inner ice giant in the case studied here. In isolation, this would cause this ice giant to migrate inward. However, because it is locked in resonance with Saturn, its eccentricity increases due to adiabatic invariance. During this process, the system crosses many weak secular resonances—many of which can disrupt the mean motion resonance and make the planetary system unstable. We argue that this basic dynamical process would work in many generic multi-resonant systems—forcing a good fraction of them to become unstable. Because the energy exchange proceeds at a very slow pace, the instability manifests itself late, on a timescale consistent with the epoch of the late heavy bombardment (\~{}700 Myr). In the migration mechanism presented here, the instability time is much less sensitive to the properties of the planetesimal disk (particularly the location of its inner edge) than in the classic Nice model mechanism.},

abstract = {Planets are believed to have formed through the accumulation of a large number of small bodies. In the case of the gas-giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, they accreted a significant amount of gas directly from the protosolar nebula after accumulating solid cores of about 5-15 Earth masses. Such models, however, have been unable to produce the smaller ice giants Uranus and Neptune at their present locations, because in that region of the Solar System the small planetary bodies will have been more widely spaced, and less tightly bound gravitationally to the Sun. When applied to the current Jupiter-Saturn zone, a recent theory predicts that, in addition to the solid cores of Jupiter and Saturn, two or three other solid bodies of comparable mass are likely to have formed. Here we report the results of model calculations that demonstrate that such cores will have been gravitationally scattered outwards as Jupiter, and perhaps Saturn, accreted nebular gas. The orbits of these cores then evolve into orbits that resemble those of Uranus and Neptune, as a result of gravitational interactions with the small bodies in the outer disk of the protosolar nebula.},

Objects with H < 6.5 (i.e., radii 170 km for a 4\% albedo) have higher inclinations than those with H > 6.5 (radii 170 km). We have shown that this relationship is not caused by any obvious observational bias. We argue that the main Kuiper belt consists of the superposition of two distinct distributions.

@article{Morbidelli2005a,
abstract = {Recent work [1][2][3] has advocated that the current structure of the Solar System can be explained if, at the end of the gas-disk phase, Jupiter and Saturn were closer to each other than their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance, namely the ratio of their orbital periods was smaller than 2. Here we show that this planetary configuration may be a natural outcome of the evolution of the planets in the gas disk. Moreover, we argue that this configuration was necessary to prevent that Type II migration brought Jupiter and Saturn much closer to the Sun. Our work extends previous results [4], by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code [5] that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in a `close' resonance (such as the 5:3, 3:2, 4:3 resonances) the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. The initial locking of the planets in a close resonance is a likely outcome if Saturn formed at the edge of Jupiter's gap. However, it is also possible if Saturn initially was beyond the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter, because the fast migration of Saturn often causes the planet to jump across this resonance.},

abstract = {We study the influence of an open cluster environment on the formation and current structure of the Oort cloud. To do this, we have run 19 different simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud for 4.5 Gyrs. In each simulation, the Solar System spends its first 100 Myrs in a different open cluster environment before transitioning to its current field environment. We find that, compared to forming in the field environment, the inner Oort cloud is preferentially loaded with comets while the Sun resides in the open cluster and that most of this material remains locked in the interior of the cloud for the next 4.4 Gyrs. In addition, the outer Oort cloud trapping efficiencies we observe in our simulations are lower than previous formation models by about a factor of 2, possibly implying an even more massive early planetesimal disk. Furthermore, some of our simulations reproduce the orbits of observed extended scattered disk objects, which may serve as an observational constraint on the Sun's early environment. Depending on the particular open cluster environment, the properties of the inner Oort cloud and extended scattered disk can vary widely. On the other hand, the outer portions of the Oort cloud in each of our simulations are all similar.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of the terrestrial planets during the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets. A basic assumption of this work is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of terrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment. The divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with k ranging from 1 to 4. Consequently these secular resonances cause large-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets. We show that the resonances g5=g\_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if Jupiter and Saturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance. On the other hand, the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are more of a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with the current one. We offer two solutions to this problem. The first uses the fact that a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a Fourier mode if the latter is large originally. A second scenario involves a 'jumping Jupiter' in which encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter, without ejection of the former, cause the latter to migrate away from Saturn much faster than if migration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals. In this case, the g5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over, or occur very briefly.},

abstract = {The existence of the Oort Comet Cloud, the Kuiper Belt, and plausible inefficiencies in planetary core formation, all suggest that there was once a residual planetesimal disk of mass 10-100 Earth-masses in the vicinity of the giant planets following their formation. Since removal of this disk requires an exchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets, significant planetary migration can ensue. The planet migration phenomenon is examined numerically by evolving the orbits of the giant planets while they are embedded in a planetesimal disk having a mass of M\_d=10 to 200 Earth-masses. We find that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune evolve radially outwards as they scatter the planetesimals, while Jupiter's orbit shrinks as it ejects mass. Higher-mass disks result in more rapid and extensive planet migration. If orbit expansion and resonance trapping by Neptune is invoked to explain the eccentricities of Pluto and its cohort of Kuiper Belt Objects at Neptune's 3:2 mean-motion resonance, then our simulations suggest that a disk mass of order M\_d\~{}50 Earth-masses is required to expand Neptune's orbit by \~{}7 AU in order to pump up Plutino eccentricities to e\~{}0.3. Such planet migration implies that the initial Solar System was more compact in the past, with the Jupiter-Neptune separation having been smaller by about 30\%. The planetesimal disk is also the source of the Oort Cloud of comets. Using the results of our simulations together with a simple treatment of Oort Cloud dynamics, we estimate that \~{}12 Earth-masses of disk material was initially deposited in the Oort Cloud, of which \~{}4 Earth-masses will persist over the age of the Solar System. The majority of these comets originated from the Saturn-Neptune region of the solar nebula.},

abstract = {Recent studies of solar system formation suggest that the solar system's giant planets formed and migrated in the protoplanetary disk to reach resonant orbits with all planets inside 15 AU from the Sun. After the gas disk's dispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and approached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of planetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the Kuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase between giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are plausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant system of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present orbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the terrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with fewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a relatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the statistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system initially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This possibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a large number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that planet ejection should be common.},

In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals.

abstract = {We use the current orbital structure of large (>50 km) asteroids in themain asteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when they migrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones.Minton\&Malhotra showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt can be reproduced by an exponentially decaying migration of the giant planets on a timescale of $\tau$ ∼ 0.5 Myr. However, self-consistent numerical simulations show that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is inconsistent with an exponential change in their semi-major axes on such a short timescale. In fact, the typical timescale is $\tau$ ? 5Myr.When giant planet migration on this timescale is applied to the asteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the observed one. However, the planet migration can be significantly sped up by planet–planet encounters. Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn have close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune itself) and where this third planet, after being scattered inward by Saturn, is scattered outward by Jupiter. This scenario leads to a very rapid increase in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn which we show here to have only mild effects on the structure of the asteroid belt. This type of evolution is called a “jumping-Jupiter” case. Our results suggest that the total mass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration were comparable to those currently observed. Moreover, they imply that, before migration, the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn were much less eccentric than their current ones. Key},

abstract = {Precise Doppler measurements during 6 yr from the Lick and Keck observatories reveal two planets orbiting GJ 876 (M4V). The orbital fit yields companion masses of Msini=0.56 and 1.89 MJ, orbital periods of P=30.1 and 61.0 days, semimajor axes of a=0.13 and 0.21 AU, and eccentricities of e=0.28 and 0.10, respectively. The orbital periods are nearly in the ratio of 2:1, unprecedented among major planets but common among moons and asteroids. Moreover, the axes of the elliptical orbits appear to be nearly aligned. The inner companion was not recognized previously owing to the 2:1 ratio of periods, which allowed its signature to masquerade as added orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Dynamical simulations show that the system is stable within a subset of the observed orbital parameters. The stability may be provided by a mean-motion resonance and the apparent alignment of the major axes. These planets pose unsolved questions about their formation and dynamical evolution, which brought them within 0.08 AU of each other and locked them in resonance.

abstract = {The irregular moons of the Jovian planets are a puzzling part of the solar system inventory. Unlike regular satellites, the irregular moons revolve around planets at large distances in tilted and eccentric orbits. Their origin, which is intimately linked with the origin of the planets themselves, is yet to be explained. Here we report a study of the orbital and collisional evolution of the irregular satellites from times after their formation to the present epoch. The purpose of this study is to find out the features of the observed irregular moons that can be attributed to this evolution and separate them from signatures of the formation process. We numerically integrated ≈60,000 test satellite orbits to map orbital locations that are stable on long time intervals. We found that the orbits highly inclined to the ecliptic are unstable due to the effect of the Kozai resonance, which radially stretches them so that satellites either escape from the Hill sphere, collide with massive inner moons, or impact the parent planet. We also found that prograde satellite orbits with large semimajor axes are unstable due to the effect of the evection resonance, which locks the orbit's apocenter to the apparent motion of the Sun around the parent planet. In such a resonance, the effect of solar tides on a resonant moon accumulates at each apocenter passage of the moon, which causes a radially outward drift of its orbital apocenter; once close to the Hill sphere, the moon escapes. By contrast, retrograde moons with large orbital semimajor axes are long-lived. We have developed an analytic model of the distant satellite orbits and used it to explain the results of our numerical experiments. In particular, we analytically studied the effect of the Kozai resonance. We numerically integrated the orbits of the 50 irregular moons (known by 2002 August 16) for 108 yr. All orbits were stable on this time interval and did not show any macroscopic variations that would indicate instabilities operating on longer time spans. The average orbits calculated from this experiment were then used to probe the collisional evolution of the irregular satellite systems. We found that (1) the large irregular moons must have collisionally eliminated many small irregular moons, thus shaping their population to the currently observed structures; (2) some dynamical families of satellites could have been formed by catastrophic collisions among the irregular moons; and (3) Phoebe's surface must have been heavily cratered by impacts from an extinct population of Saturnian irregular moons, much larger than the present one. We therefore suggest that the Cassini imaging of Phoebe in 2004 can be used to determine the primordial population of small irregular moons of Saturn. In such a case, we will also better understand the overall efficiency of the formation process of the irregular satellites and the physical conditions that existed during planetary formation. We discovered two dynamical families of tightly clustered orbits within the Jovian retrograde group. We believe that these two clusters may be the remnants of two collisionally disrupted bodies. We found that the entire Jovian retrograde group and the Saturnian inclination groups were not produced by single breakups, because the ejection velocities derived from the orbital structures of these groups greatly exceed values calculated by modern numerical models of collisional breakups. Taken together, the evidence presented here suggests that many properties of the irregular moons previously assigned to their formation process may have resulted from their later dynamical and collisional evolution. Finally, we have found that several irregular moons, namely, Pasiphae, Sinope, S/2001 J10, S/2000 S5, S/2000 S6, and S/2000 S3, have orbits characterized by secular resonances. The orbits of some of these moons apparently evolved by some slow dissipative process in the past and became captured in tiny resonant volumes.},

abstract = {We have developed and tested a computer code to follow the long-term dynamical evolution of a swarm of test particles in the solar system. The technique effciently and accurately handles close approaches between test particles and planets while retaining the powerful features of recently developed mixed variable symplectic integrators. We use the code to numerically integrate the orbits of the known short-period comets under the influence of the Sun and all planets except Mercury and Pluto, for times up to 107 years. It is found under a classification based on period that most comets move between Jupiter-family and Halley-family orbits many times in their dynamical lifetimes. We adopt a classification that defines Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) as comets with T greater than 2 and Halley-family comets (HFCs) as those with T less than 2. In this scheme, less than 8\% of comets change families during the integration and most of those that change tend to remain near the Tisserand dividing line throughout. Thus, the JFCs are dynamically distinct from the HFCs. We find that in our forward integration, 92\% of comets are ejected from the solar system, and that approximately 6\% are destroyed by becoming sun-grazers. The number of sun-grazers is far more than would be expected from the existing analytic theories. The median lifetime of all known short-period comets from the current time to ultimate destruction or ejection is approximately 4.5 x 105 years. The very flat inclination distribution of (JFCs) found to become more distended as it ages. Since JFCs are dynamically distinct from HFCs, they must have an inclination distribution, when they first become visible, that is even flatter than that currently observed. For reasonable values of the physical lifetime before fading, we calculate that there should be roughly 5-20 times as many extinct JFCs as currently known JFCs.},

abstract = {The lunar Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) defines a time between ˜3.8 to possibly 4.1 Gy ago when the Nectarian and early-Imbrium basins on the Moon with reasonably well-constrained ages were formed. Some have argued that these basins were produced by a terminal cataclysm that caused a spike in the inner Solar System impactor flux during this interval. Others have suggested the basins were formed by the tail end of a monotonically decreasing impactor population originally produced by planet formation processes in the inner Solar System. Here we investigate whether this so-called declining bombardment scenario of the LHB is consistent with constraints provided by planet formation models as well as the inferred ages of Nectaris, Serenitatis, Imbrium, and Orientale. We did this by modeling the collisional and dynamical evolution of the post-planet formation population (PPP) for a range of starting PPP masses. Using a Monte Carlo code, we computed the probability that the aforementioned basins were created at various times after the Moon-forming event approximately 4.54 Ga. Our results indicate that the likelihood that the declining bombardment scenario produced Nectaris, Serenitatis, Imbrium, and Orientale (or even just Imbrium and Orientale) at any of their predicted ages is extremely low and can be ruled out at the 3 $\sigma$ confidence level, regardless of the PPP's starting mass. The reason is that collisional and dynamical evolution quickly depletes the PPP, leaving behind a paucity of large projectiles capable of producing the Moon's youngest basins between 3.8-4.1 Gy ago. If collisions are excluded from our model, we find that the PPP produces numerous South Pole-Aitken-like basins during the pre-Nectarian period. This is inconsistent with our understanding of lunar topography. Accordingly, our results lead us to conclude that the terminal cataclysm scenario is the only existing LHB paradigm at present that is both viable from a dynamical modeling perspective and consistent with existing constraints.},

abstract = {Most highland total rock samples define a single Usingle bondPb isochron which corresponds to a metamorphism age of ∼ 3.9AE. This age is also obtained for internal Usingle bondPb isochrons for some of these samples. The data on 18 rock samples range from concordant samples with238U/206Pb∼ 1.2 to discordant ones with238U/206Pb∼ 0.02. This feature coupled with a correlated pattern of 238U/204Pb ratios, indicates that Pb was extensively mobilized at ∼ 3.9AE. The observed Pbsingle bondU fractionation is essentially due to Pb volatilization during the metamorphic events. Volatile Pb transport is not accompanied by similar effects in Rb and must therefore be attributed to a specific process. Rbsingle bondSr internal isochrons for the same rocks determine distinct metamorphic events in the interval 3.85–4.00 AE. We conclude that highland samples from widely separated areas bear the imprint of an event or series of events in a narrow time interval which can be identified with a cataclysmic impacting rate of the moon at ∼ 3.9AE, although differentiation by internal magma generation cannot be excluded. This cataclysm is associated with the Imbrium impact and very possibly the formation of Crisium and Orientale and possibly several other major basins in a narrow time interval (∼2 × 108yr or less). The Usingle bondPb data indicate formation of the lunar crust at ∼ 4.4AE, which is distinctly younger than 4.6 AE, the time generally associated with planetary formation. If the lunar crust started being formed at ∼ 4.6AE, then this process must have continued until times significantly younger than 4.4 AE. Rbsingle bondSr data also indicate formation of the lunar crust around 4.5 AE with only minor additions of high Rb/Sr materials to the crust at times younger than 4.3 AE. Using the Usingle bondPb systematics, K/U and the average U concentration of the moon as obtained from heat-flow measurements, we estimate the lunar concentrations: primordial Pb= 35ppb;Rb= 0.5ppm with Rb/Sr= 0.006.},

abstract = {The petrology record on the Moon suggests that a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred approximately 700 million years after the planets formed; this event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Planetary formation theories cannot naturally account for an intense period of planetesimal bombardment so late in Solar System history. Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the observational constraints of the outer Solar System.},

abstract = {Jupiter's Trojans are asteroids that follow essentially the same orbit as Jupiter, but lead or trail the planet by an angular distance of approximately 60 degrees (co-orbital motion). They are hypothesized to be planetesimals that formed near Jupiter and were captured onto their current orbits while Jupiter was growing, possibly with the help of gas drag and/or collisions. This idea, however, cannot explain some basic properties of the Trojan population, in particular its broad orbital inclination distribution, which ranges up to approximately 40 degrees (ref. 8). Here we show that the Trojans could have formed in more distant regions and been subsequently captured into co-orbital motion with Jupiter during the time when the giant planets migrated by removing neighbouring planetesimals. The capture was possible during a short period of time, just after Jupiter and Saturn crossed their mutual 1:2 resonance, when the dynamics of the Trojan region were completely chaotic. Our simulations of this process satisfactorily reproduce the orbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass.},

abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (Haisch et al. 2001) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only \~{}100,000 years (Armitage 2007). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration (Masset \& Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli \& Crida 2007, Pierens \& Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

abstract = {We report the results of the first sensitive L-band survey of the intermediate-age (2.5-30 Myr) clusters NGC 2264, NGC 2362, and NGC 1960. We use JHKL colors to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fractions in each cluster. We find disk fractions of 52\%+/-10\%, 12\%+/-4\%, and 3\%+/-3\% for the three clusters, respectively. Together with our previously published JHKL investigations of the younger NGC 2024, Trapezium, and IC 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (>=80\%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in <\~{}3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of \~{}6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The recent discoveries of massive planetary companions orbiting several solar-type stars pose a conundrum. Conventional models for the formation of giant planets (such as Jupiter and Saturn) place such objects at distances of several astronomical units from the parent star, whereas all but one of the new objects are on orbits well inside 1 AU; these planets must therefore have originated at larger distances and subsequently migrated inwards. One suggested migration mechanism invokes tidal interactions between the planet and the evolving circumstellar disk. Such a mechanism results in planets with small, essentially circular orbits, which appears to be the case for many of the new planets. But two of the objects have substantial orbital eccentricities, which are difficult to reconcile with a tidal-linkage model. Here we describe an alternative model for planetary migration that can account for these large orbital eccentricities. If a system of three or more giant planets form about a star, their orbits may become unstable as they gain mass by accreting gas from the circumstellar disk; subsequent gravitational encounters among these planets can eject one from the system while placing the others into highly eccentric orbits both closer and farther from the star.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim is to check whether the Nice model - which refers to an initially compact configuration of the giant planets that lasted for about 700 Myr and eventually became unstable when Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 2:1 mean motion resonance - is consistent with what we know of the Oort cloud, and to provide an explanation for the mass and structure of the Oort cloud. Methods: A two-stage formation scenario of the Oort cloud is proposed. The starting condition is the Nice model of planet migration, which contains a disc outside Neptune with a mass of 35 M⊕. From the formation efficiency I calculate the amount of mass deposited in the outer Oort cloud (comets with semi-major axis a > 20 000 AU; the inner Oort cloud has comets with semi-major axis a < 20 000 AU) and the innermost Oort cloud (a ⪉ 3000 AU). The latter formed when the Sun was part of its birth cluster i.e. before the outer cloud. Results: The mass of the innermost Oort cloud directly inferred from the Nice model is 2.4 M⊕ to 7.2 M⊕, with a value around 5 M⊕ the most probable. The mass in the outer Oort cloud ranges from 0.5 M⊕ to 1 M⊕, with a value close to 0.9 M⊕ being the most likely. Current estimates of the mass in the outer cloud based on observations range from 0.6 M⊕ to 1.4 M⊕, in excellent agreement with predictions. Comets in the outer cloud come both directly from the disc outside Neptune as well as diffusion from the inner(most) cloud due to perturbations by passing stars.},

In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastrom distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.},

abstract = {Models of the evolution of Neptune's migration and the dynamical processes at work during the formation of the outer solar system can be constrained by measuring the orbital distribution of the remnant planetesimals in the Kuiper belt. Determining the true orbit distribution is not simple because the detection and tracking of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) is a highly biased process. In this chapter we examine the various biases that are present in any survey of the Kuiper belt. We then present observational and analysis strategies that can help to minimize the effects of these biases on the inferred orbital distributions. We find that material currently classified as the classical Kuiper belt is well represented by two subpopulations: a high-inclination component that spans and uniformly fills the stable phase space between 30 and 47 AU combined with a low-inclination, low-eccentricity population enhancement between 42 and 45 AU. The low-i, low-e component may be that which has long been called the "Kuiper belt." We also find weaker evidence that the high-i component of the classical Kuiper belt may extend beyond the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. The scattering/detached disk appears to extend to larger semimajor axis with no evidence for a falloff steeper than r-1. This population is likely at least as large as the classical Kuiper belt population and has an i/e distribution much like that of the hot classical Kuiper belt. We also find that the fraction of objects in the 3:2 resonance is likely around 20\% and previous estimates that place this population at \~{}5\% are inconsistent with present observations. Additionally, high-order mean-motion resonances play a substantial role in the structure of the Kuiper belt.},

 AU, q = 74 AU, unofficially known as Sedna) is a major test for our understanding of the primordial
 evolution of the outer solar system. Gladman et al. have shown that 2000 CR 105 could not have been
 a normal member of the scattered disk that had its perihelion distance increased by chaotic
 diffusion. The same conclusion also clearly applies to 2003 VB 12 . In this paper, we explore five
 seemingly promising mechanisms to explain the origin of the orbits of these peculiar objects: (1)
 the passage of Neptune through a high-eccentricity phase, (2) the past existence of massive
 planetary embryos in the Kuiper belt or the scattered disk, (3) the presence of a massive
 trans-Neptunian disk at early epochs that perturbed highly inclined scattered-disk objects, (4)
 encounters with other stars that perturbed the orbits of some of the solar system's trans-Neptunian
 planetesimals, and (5) the capture of extrasolar planetesimals from low-mass stars or brown dwarfs
 encountering the Sun. Of all these mechanisms, the ones giving the most satisfactory results are
 those related to the passage of stars (4 and 5). An important advantage of both stellar-passage
 scenarios is that all the resulting objects with large perihelion distances also have large
 semimajor axes. This is in good agreement with the fact that 2000 CR 105 and 2003 VB 12 have
 semimajor axes larger than 200 AU and no other bodies with similar perihelion distances but smaller
 semimajor axes have yet been discovered. We favor mechanism 4, since it produces an orbital element
 distribution that is more consistent with the observations, unless 2000 CR 105 and 2003 VB 12
 represent a population more massive than a few tenths of an Earth mass, in which case this mechanism
 is not viable.},

This paper reports a study of the apparent magnitude distribution of faint objects in the Kuiper Belt, obtained via deep imaging on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the ESO Very Large Telescope UT1. We find that the entire range of observed objects (magnitudes mR\~{}20-27) is well represented by an unbroken power law, with the number of objects per square degree brighter than magnitude R being of the form $\Sigma$(mR<R)=10$\alpha$(R-R0), with $\alpha$=0.69 and R0=23.5. This luminosity function's slope implies a steep size distribution in the observed range, which should ``roll over'' to a shallower ``collisional'' slope once observations extend to even fainter magnitudes and thus sample bodies whose collisional ages become less than the age of the solar system. Our observations indicate the roll over is for diameters of less than 50 km, in agreement with collisional models.

abstract = {The main asteroid belt, which inhabits a relatively narrow annulus 2.1–3.3 AU from the Sun, contains a surprising diversity of objects ranging from primitive ice–rock mixtures to igneous rocks. The standard model used to explain this assumes that most asteroids formed in situ from a primordial disk that experienced radical chemical changes within this zone . Here we show that the violent dynamical evolution of the giant-planet orbits required by the so- called Nice model leads to the insertion of primitive trans- Neptunian objects into the outer belt. This result implies that the observed diversity of the asteroid belt is not a direct reflection of the intrinsic compositional variation of the proto-planetary disk. The dark captured bodies, composed of organic-rich materi- als, would have been more susceptible to collisional evolution than typical main-belt asteroids. Their weak nature makes them a pro- digious source of micrometeorites—sufficient to explain why most are primitive in composition and are isotopically different from most macroscopic meteorites.},

abstract = {This paper deals with Oort cloud formation while the Sun was in an embedded cluster and surrounded by its primordial nebula. This work is a continuation of Brasser et al. [Brasser, R., Duncan, M., Levison, H., 2006. Icarus 184, 59–82], building on the model presented therein, and adding the aerodynamic drag and gravitational potential of the primordial solar nebula. Results are presented of numerical simulations of comets subject to the gravitational influence of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, star cluster and primordial solar nebula; some of the simulations included the gravitational influence of Uranus and Neptune as well. The primordial solar nebula was approximated by the minimum-mass Hayashi model [Hayashi, C., Nakozawa, K., Nakagawa, Y., 1985. In: Black, D.C., Matthews, M.S. (Eds.). Protostars and Planets II. Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ] whose inner and outer radii have been truncated at various distances from the Sun. A comet size of 1.7 km was used for most of our simulations. In all of our simulations, the density of the primordial solar nebula decayed exponentially with an e-folding time of 2 Myr. It turns out that when the primordial solar nebula extends much beyond Saturn or Neptune, virtually no material will end up in the Oort cloud (OC) during this phase. Instead, the majority of the material will be on circular orbits inside of Jupiter if the inner edge of the disk is well inside Jupiter's orbit. If the disk's inner edge is beyond Jupiter's orbit, most comets end up on orbits in exterior mean-motion resonances with Saturn when Uranus and Neptune are not present. In those cases where the outer edge of the disk is close to Saturn or Neptune, the fraction of material that ends up in the subsequently formed OC is much less than that found in Brasser et al. [Brasser, R., Duncan, M., Levison, H., 2006. Icarus 184, 59–82] for the same cluster densities. This implies that for comets of roughly 2 km in size, the presence of the primordial solar nebula hinders OC formation. A byproduct of some of our simulations are endresults with a substantial fraction of the comets in the Uranus–Neptune scattered disk. A subsequent followup of this material is planned for the near future. In order to determine the effect of the size of the comets on OC formation efficiency, a set of runs with the same initial conditions but different cometary radii have been performed as well, from which it is determined that the threshold comet size to begin producing significant Oort clouds is roughly 20 km. This implies that the presence of the primordial solar nebula acts as a size-sorting mechanism, with large bodies unaffected by the gas drag and ending up in the OC while small bodies remain trapped in the planetary region, in the models studied.},

abstract = {The barrage of comets and asteroids that produced many young lunar basins (craters over 300 kilometres in diameter) has frequently been called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Many assume the LHB ended about 3.7 to 3.8 billion years (Gyr) ago with the formation of Orientale basin. Evidence for LHB-sized blasts on Earth, however, extend into the Archaean and early Proterozoic eons, in the form of impact spherule beds: globally distributed ejecta layers created by Chicxulub-sized or larger cratering events4. At least seven spherule beds have been found that formed between 3.23 and 3.47 Gyr ago, four between 2.49 and 2.63 Gyr ago, and one between 1.7 and 2.1 Gyr ago. Here we report that the LHB lasted much longer than previously thought, with most late impactors coming from the E belt, an extended and now largely extinct portion of the asteroid belt between 1.7 and 2.1 astronomical units from Earth. This region was destabilized by late giant planet migration. E-belt survivors now make up the high-inclination Hungaria asteroids. Scaling from the observed Hungaria asteroids, we find that E-belt projectiles made about ten lunar basins between 3.7 and 4.1 Gyr ago. They also produced about 15 terrestrial basins between 2.5 and 3.7 Gyr ago, as well as around 70 and four Chicxulub-sized or larger craters on the Earth and Moon, respectively, between 1.7 and 3.7 Gyr ago. These rates reproduce impact spherule bed and lunar crater constraints.},

Using a hybrid approach (Charnoz \&amp; Morbidelli 2003), we try to couple the primordial collisional and dynamical evolution of these three populations in a self-consistent way. We show that the initial planetesimal size distribution that allows an effective mass depletion of the Kuiper Belt by collisional grinding, would decimate also the population of comet-size bodies that end in the Oort Cloud and in the Scattered Disk. These two reservoirs would therefore be too anemic, by a factor 40 to 100, relative to the estimates achieved from the observation of the fluxes of long period and jupiter family comets, respectively. For these two reservoirs to have a sufficient number of comets, the initial size distribution in the planetesimal disk had to be such that the mass depletion by collisional erosion of in the Kuiper belt was negligible.},

abstract = {In the recent years, the "Nice" model of solar system formation has attained an unprecedented level of success in reproducing much of the observed orbital architecture of the solar system by evolving the planets to their current locations from a more compact configuration. Within the context of this model, the formation of the classical Kuiper Belt requires a phase during which the ice giants have a high eccentricity. An outstanding question of this model is the initial configuration from which the solar system started out. Recent work has shown that multi-resonant initial conditions can serve as good candidates, as they naturally prevent vigorous type-II migration. In this paper, we use analytical arguments, as well as self-consistent numerical N-body simulations to identify fully resonant initial conditions, whose dynamical evolution is characterized by an eccentric phase of the ice giants, as well as planetary scattering. We find a total of eight such initial conditions. Four of these primordial states are compatible with the canonical "Nice" model, while the others imply slightly different evolutions. The results presented here should prove useful in further development of a comprehensive model for solar system formation.},

abstract = {Observations suggest most stars originate in clusters embedded in giant molecular clouds [Lada, C.J., Lada, E.A., 2003. Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 41, 57–115]. Our Solar System likely spent 1–5 Myrs in such regions just after it formed. Thus the Oort Cloud (OC) possibly retains evidence of the Sun's early dynamical history and of the stellar and tidal influence of the cluster. Indeed, the newly found objects (90377) Sedna and 2000 CR105 may have been put on their present orbits by such processes [Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2004. Astron. J. 128, 2564–2576]. Results are presented here of numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of comets subject to the influence of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn (with their current masses on orbits appropriate to the period before the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) [Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2005. Nature 435, 459–461]), passing stars and tidal force associated with the gas and stars of an embedded star cluster. The cluster was taken to be a Plummer model with 200–400 stars, with a range of initial central densities. The Sun's orbit was integrated in the cluster potential together with Jupiter and Saturn and the test particles. Stellar encounters were incorporated by directly integrating the effects of stars passing within a sphere centred on the Sun of radius equal to the Plummer radius for low-density clusters and half a Plummer radius for high-density clusters. The gravitational influence of the gas was modeled using the tidal force of the cluster potential. For a given solar orbit, the mean density, 〈$\rho$〉, was computed by orbit-averaging the density of material encountered. This parameter proved to be a good measure for predicting the properties of the OC. On average 2–18\% of our initial sample of comets end up in the OC after 1–3 Myr. A comet is defined to be part of the OC if it is bound and has q>35 AU. Our models show that the median distance of an object in the OC scales approximately as 〈$\rho$〉−1/2 when 〈$\rho$〉≳10 M⊙pc−3. Our models easily produce objects on orbits like that of (90377) Sedna [Brown, M.E., Trujillo, C., Rabinowitz, D., 2004. Astrophys. J. 617, 645–649] within ∼1 Myr in cases where the mean density is 103 M⊙pc−3 or higher; one needs mean densities of order 104 M⊙pc−3 to create objects like 2000 CR105 by this mechanism, which are reasonable (see, e.g., Guthermuth, R.A., Megeath, S.T., Pipher, J.L., Williams, J.P., Allen, L.E., Myers, P.C., Raines, S.N., 2005. Astrophys. J. 632, 397–420). Thus the latter object may also be part of the OC. Close stellar passages can stir the primordial Kuiper Belt to sufficiently high eccentricities (e≳0.05; Kenyon, S.J., Bromley, B.C., 2002. Astron. J. 123, 1757–1775) that collisions become destructive. From the simulations performed it is determined that there is a 50\% or better chance to stir the primordial Kuiper Belt to eccentricities e⩾0.05 at 50 AU when 〈$\rho$〉≳105 M⊙pc−3. The orbit of the new object 2003 UB313 [Brown, M.E., Trujillo, C.A., Rabinowitz, D.L., 2005. Astrophys. J. 635, L97–L100] is only reproduced for mean cluster densities of the order of 105 M⊙pc−3, but in the simulations it could not come to be on its current orbit by this mechanism without disrupting the formation of bodies in the primordial Kuiper Belt down to 20 AU. It is therefore improbable that the latter object is created by this mechanism.},

Beyond the edge is a sparse population of objects with large orbital eccentricities. Neptune shapes the dynamics of most Kuiper belt objects, but the recently discovered planet 2003 VB12 (Sedna) has an eccentric orbit with a perihelion distance of 70 au, far beyond Neptune's gravitational influence. Although influences from passing stars could have created the Kuiper belt's outer edge and could have scattered objects into large, eccentric orbits, no model currently explains the properties of Sedna. Here we show that a passing star probably scattered Sedna from the Kuiper belt into its observed orbit. The likelihood that a planet at 60-80 au can be scattered into Sedna's orbit is about 50 per cent; this estimate depends critically on the geometry of the fly-by. Even more interesting is the approximately 10 per cent chance that Sedna was captured from the outer disk of the passing star. Most captures have very high inclination orbits; detection of such objects would confirm the presence of extrasolar planets in our own Solar System.},

Our investigation extends the previous works by Masset \& Snellgrove and Morbidelli \& Crida, which focused on the dynamics of the Jupiter-Saturn system. The only systems we found to reach a steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple mean-motion resonance (i.e., each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). In total, we found six such configurations. For the gas-disk parameters found in Morbidelli \& Crida, these configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. After the disappearance of the gas, and in the absence of planetesimals, only two of these six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time of hundreds of millions of years or more. The others become unstable on a timescale of a few Myr. Our preliminary simulations show that, when a planetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, the planets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to their current orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in Tsiganis et al.},

abstract = {Iapetus has preserved evidence that constrains the modeling of its geophysical history from the time of its accretion until now. The evidence is (a) its present 79.33-day rotation or spin rate, (b) its shape that corresponds to the equilibrium figure for a hydrostatic body rotating with a period of ∼16 h, and (c) its high, equatorial ridge, which is unique in the Solar System. This paper reports the results of an investigation into the coupling between Iapetus' thermal and orbital evolution for a wide range of conditions including the spatial distributions with time of composition, porosity, short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI), and temperature. The thermal model uses conductive heat transfer with temperature-dependent conductivity. Only models with a thick lithosphere and an interior viscosity in the range of about the water ice melting point can explain the observed shape. Short-lived radioactive isotopes provide the heat needed to decrease porosity in Iapetus' early history. This increases thermal conductivity and allows the development of the strong lithosphere that is required to preserve the 16-h rotational shape and the high vertical relief of the topography. Long-lived radioactive isotopes and SLRI raise internal temperatures high enough that significant tidal dissipation can start, and despin Iapetus to synchronous rotation. This occurred several hundred million years after Iapetus formed. The models also constrain the time when Iapetus formed because the successful models are critically dependent upon having just the right amount of heat added by SLRI decay in this early period. The amount of heat available from short-lived radioactivity is not a free parameter but is fixed by the time when Iapetus accreted, by the canonical concentration of 26Al, and, to a lesser extent, by the concentration of 60Fe. The needed amount of heat is available only if Iapetus accreted between 2.5 and 5.0 Myr after the formation of the calcium aluminum inclusions as found in meteorites. Models with these features allow us to explain Iapetus' present synchronous rotation, its fossil 16-h shape, and the context within which the equatorial ridge arose.},

abstract = {We present results of several numerical simulations of fictitious Trojan asteroids under different resonant configurations of the outer planets, especially between Jupiter and Saturn. Although the present outer solar system is not locked in mean motion resonances, such commensurabilities may have been temporarily attained in the past if current theories of planetary migration are correct. By studying the evolution of Trojan-like test particles under these conditions, it is possible to obtain information related to the maximum variation of the semimajor axes of the two major Jovian planets, as well as insights on the duration of the migration itself. Results show that the 2S : 1J and 5S : 2J Jupiter-Saturn resonances introduce large instabilities in the Trojan region. In the case of 2S : 1J, a few thousand years are sufficient to expel all particles initially in tadpole orbits. For 5S : 2J, these may survive for up to 106 yr. The 7S : 3J commensurability, on the other hand, is much less disruptive. These results seem to indicate that the observed presence of the Jovian Trojans is compatible with a planetary migration as proposed by Han \& Malhotra, in which the orbital distance between Jupiter and Saturn did not vary by more about 1 AU.

abstract = {Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) are an ancient reservoir of comets beyond Neptune's orbit. Some of these objects were recently found to have the reddest optical colours in the Solar System, but the number of objects for which accurate colours were available was too small for any correlation to be discerned between colour and physical or dynamical properties, which might shed light on the origin of these objects. Here we report that all nine of the KBOs in our survey on near-circular (low-eccentricity) orbits with perihelion distances larger than 40 AU have extremely red surfaces, thereby connecting an observable property with a dynamical class. Of the objects with orbital eccentricities greater than 0.1, about half are also very red, while the rest have colours similar to the Sun, meaning that reflected sunlight is not strongly modified by the objects' surface properties. In addition, of the 13 'classical' KBOs (those with semimajor axis a approximately 45 AU and eccentricity e < 0.15), the ten that are very red are in orbits with small angles of inclination to the ecliptic, whereas the three with solar colours are all in high-inclination orbits. We suggest that these three 'grey' classical KBOs may be part of a dynamical group that is separate from the 'red' classical KBOs.},

abstract = {We present the results of spectral modeling of 17 Trojan asteroids. The surface composition of this group of objects (located just beyond the main belt, trapped in Jupiter's stable Lagrange points) remains uncertain due to an absence of diagnostic absorption features in their spectra. We quantitatively analyze spectra of these objects covering the range 0.3–4.0 $\mu$m using the formulation for scattering in a particulate medium developed by Hapke. Since the widest spectral range possible is desired to provide the most robust results, recently measured near-IR spectra are combined with previously published visible and near-IR data. These composite spectra are converted to and modeled in terms of geometric albedo to provide the additional constraint of the absolute brightness of the asteroids. It is important that this modeling is performed for a large number of objects, and results are derived based on trends among best-fit models. Under this rigorous examination, we find that it is unlikely that the red spectral slope is a result of organics on the surfaces, due mainly to the lack of absorptions in the L-band. Instead, anhydrous silicates adequately describe the spectral characteristics of this group of objects. A significant fraction of carbonaceous material is also likely present, but is not responsible for the red spectral slope in these models. Also, using these models, we estimate that these surfaces contain at most a few wt\% of H2O ice and no more than 10–30 wt\% of hydrated silicates.},

A linear model and an exponential model for migration are used. Migration speeds are deÐned by several total migration times for the linear model and by two dierent timescales for the exponential model. The migration process is found to develop great instability on Saturn Trojans. It is a much more stable process for Jupiter and the two outermost major planets\"{I} Trojans. The instability produced by migration is also found to be strongly dependent on the initial orbits of the planets. Migration can explain why Saturn Trojans have not been found up to date. It can also explain the absence of these bodies for Uranus and Neptune if initial positions for Neptune closer to the Sun are assumed. In order that migration does not create too much instability for Jupiter Trojans, initial positions for the pair Jupiter-Saturn should not be as close as usually supposed. For the exponential model and timescale 2.5106 yr, there is a signiÐcant trend of Jupiter Trojan survivors to the L4 point. The results of this work and previous ones about planetary migration can impose some constraints on possible initial posi- tions for the major planets.},

abstract = {The Solar system beyond Neptune is believed to house a population of small primordial bodies left over from the planet formation process. The region up to heliocentric distance ˜50 AU (a.k.a. the Kuiper Belt) may be the source of the observed short-period comets. In this region, the phase space structure near orbital resonances with Neptune is of special interest for the long-term stability of orbits. There is reason to believe that a significant fraction (perhaps most) of the Kuiper Belt objects reside preferentially in these resonance locations. This paper describes the dynamics of small objects near the major orbital resonances with Neptune. Estimates of the widths of stable resonance zones as well as the properties of resonant orbits are obtained from the circular, planar restricted three-body model. Although this model does not contain the full complexity of the long-term orbital dynamics of Kuiper Belt objects subject to the full N-body perturbations of all the planets, it does provide a baseline for the phase space structure and properties of resonant orbits in the trans-Neptunian Solar system.},

abstract = {In the primordial Solar System the most plausible sources of the water accreted by the Earth were in the outer asteroid belt, in the giant planet regions and in the Kuiper belt. We investigate the implications on the origin of Earth's water of dynamical models of primordial evolution of solar system bodies and check them with respect to chemical constraints. We find that it is plausible that the Earth accreted water all along its formation, from the early phases when the solar nebula was still present to the late stages of gas-free sweepup of scattered planetesimals. Asteroids and the comets from the Jupiter-Saturn region were the first water deliverers, when the Earth was less than half its present mass. The bulk of the water presently on Earth was carried by a few planetary embryos, originally formed in the outer asteroid belt and accreted by the Earth at the final stage of its formation. Finally, a late veneer, accounting for at most 10\% of the present water mass, occurred due to comets from the Uranus-Neptune region and from the Kuiper belt. The net result of accretion from these several reservoirs is that the water on Earth had essentially the D/H ratio typical of the water condensed in the outer asteroid belt. This is in agreement with the observation that the D/H ratio in the oceans is very close to the mean value of the D/H ratio of the water inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites.},

abstract = {Where have all the Tritons gone, long time ago? A natural consequence of the accumulation stage of planetary formation is the scattering of planetesimals during the accretion epoch. In the outer Solar System, such scattering contributed to the formation of the Oort cloud (with an orbital semimajor axis distribution 103 < a < 5 < 104 AU) and the Kuiper disk (30 < a < 500 AU). We suggest here that in addition to comets, a potentially large number of planetary bodies in the size class near 1000 km may have also been scattered into the Kuiper disk and Oort cloud. This hypothesis implies that the present population of planets in the outer Solar System is much larger than previously recognized. To support this claim, we present calculations showing that the large tilts of Uranus and Neptune, the capture of Triton, and the formation of the Pluto-Charon binary each argue for the past presence of numerous 1000-km bodies in 20–50 AU region. We then summarize arguments that scattering dominated other loss processes for these objects, leading to the conclusion that many of these bodies should presently be located beyond the “regular” planetary system. Finally, we examine the detection prospects for such bodies, and compare the existing observational constraints to our model predictions of the number of such bodies in the region between 30 and 500 AU from the Sun.},

abstract = {Runaway growth ends when the largest protoplanets dominate the dynamics of the planetesimal disk; the subsequent self-limiting accretion mode is referred to as “oligarchic growth.” Here, we begin by expanding on the existing analytic model of the oligarchic growth regime. From this, we derive global estimates of the planet formation rate throughout a protoplanetary disk. We find that a relatively high-mass protoplanetary disk (∼10 × minimum-mass) is required to produce giant planet core-sized bodies (∼10 M⊕) within the lifetime of the nebular gas (≲10 million years). However, an implausibly massive disk is needed to produce even an Earth mass at the orbit of Uranus by 10 Myrs. Subsequent accretion without the dissipational effect of gas is even slower and less efficient. In the limit of noninteracting planetesimals, a reasonable-mass disk is unable to produce bodies the size of the Solar System’s two outer giant planets at their current locations on any timescale; if collisional damping of planetesimal random velocities is sufficiently effective, though, it may be possible for a Uranus/Neptune to form in situ in less than the age of the Solar System. We perform numerical simulations of oligarchic growth with gas and find that protoplanet growth rates agree reasonably well with the analytic model as long as protoplanet masses are well below their estimated final masses. However, accretion stalls earlier than predicted, so that the largest final protoplanet masses are smaller than those given by the model. Thus the oligarchic growth model, in the form developed here, appears to provide an upper limit for the efficiency of giant planet formation.},

@article{Petit2001,
abstract = {In this paper, we use N-body integrations to study the effect that planetary embryos spread between ∼0.5 and 4 AU would have on primordial asteroids. The most promising model for the formation of the terrestrial planets assumes the presence of such embryos at the time of formation of Jupiter. At the end of their runaway growth phase, the embryos are on quasi-circular orbits, with masses comparable to that of the Moon or Mars. Due to gravitational interactions among them, and with the growing Jupiter, their orbits begin to cross each other, and they collide, forming bigger bodies. A general outcome of this model is that a few planets form in a stable configuration in the terrestrial planet region, while the asteroid belt is cleared of embryos. Due to combined gravitational perturbations from Jupiter and the embryos, the primordial asteroids are dynamically excited. Most of the asteroids are ejected from the system in a very short time, the dynamical lifetime being on the order of 1 My. A few asteroids (less than 1\%) survive, mostly in the region 2.8–3.3 AU, and their eccentricity and inclination distribution qualitatively resembles the observed one. The surviving asteroids have undergone changes in semimajor axis of several tenths of an AU, which could explain the observed radial mixing of asteroid taxonomic types. When the distribution of massive embryos is truncated at 3 AU, we obtain too many asteroids in the outer part of the belt, especially too many Hildas. This suggests that the formation of Jupiter did not prohibit the formation of large embryos in the outer belt and Jupiter did not accrete them while it was still growing.},

abstract = {Acritical element for the understanding of asteroid collisional evolution is the scaling law needed to link laboratory impact experiments to the fragmentation of asteroidal bodies, ranging in size from meters to several hundreds of km. Early workers generally assumed a simple energy scaling, augmented by gravitational self-compression. Recent work on scaling theories has produced algorithms for computing the specific energy, Q∗, required to fragment bodies of various sizes, based on two approaches: the strain-rate scaling theory of Housen and Holsapple (Icarus, 84, 226, 1990), based on dimensional analysis, and the 2-D hydrocode ealculations of Ryan and Melosh (1994). The strain-rate scaling predicts a deerease of about an Order of magnitude when going from laboratory sized bodies, 10 cm, to bodies a few tens of km in size, whereas for larger sizes Q∗, grows due to gravitational self- compression. The hydrocode results show an even stronger dependence on size, with a Q∗ decrease of 2–3 orders of magnitude between 10 cm and 25 km, depending on the properties of the material. One possible way to discriminate among these different scaling laws is to examine which of them (if any) can predict the observed size distribution of asteroids from arbitrary starting populations and simultaneously satisfy other constraints on asteroid collisional history, such as the preservation of Vesta's basaltic crust. We have now explored this problem using the asteroid collisional evolution model of Davis et al. (AsteroidsII, pp. 805–826, University of Arizona Press, Tuscon, 1989), modified to take the different scaling algorithms as an input option. These model calculations show that a comparatively large value of Q∗ is neede to match the observed size distribution and to preserve Vesta's crust. Simple energy scaling with gravitational self-compression in agreement with the laboratory experiments of Housen et al. (Iearus94, 180, 1991) does the best of reproducing the observed asteroid belf. Strain-rate scaling could also match the observations; however, extension of our knowledge of the main-belt population down to sizes of ∼ 1 km would test this agreement. The hydrocode scaling results generally predict weak asteroids and do not reproduce the size distribution, nor do they allow Vesta's crust to be preserved except in a highly improbable fashion. The hydrocode scaling of Q∗ however, provides only a shattering threshold; work to derive the corresponding scaling law for the energy partitioning coefficient, needed to model the dispersal/reaccumulation of fragments, is under way.},

abstract = {We search 0.02 deg2 of the invariable plane for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) 25 AU or more distant using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. With 22 ks per pointing, the search is more than 50\% complete for m606W<=29.2. Three new objects are discovered, the faintest with mean magnitude m=28.3 (diameter \~{}25 km), which is 3 mag fainter than any previously well-measured solar system body. Each new discovery is verified with a follow-up 18 ks observation with the ACS, and the detection efficiency is verified with implanted objects. The three detections are a factor of \~{}25 less than would be expected under extrapolation of the power-law differential sky density for brighter objects, $\Sigma$(m)≡dN/dmd$\Omega$\~{}10$\alpha$m with $\alpha$\~{}0.63. Analysis of the ACS data and recent TNO surveys from the literature reveals departures from this power law at both the bright and faint ends. Division of the TNO sample by distance and inclination into ``classical Kuiper belt'' (CKB) and ``Excited'' samples reveals that $\Sigma$(m) differs for the two populations at 96\% confidence, and both samples show departures from power-law behavior. A double power-law $\Sigma$(m) adequately fits all data. Implications of these departures include the following: (1) The total mass of the ``classical'' Kuiper belt is \~{}0.010 M⊕, only a few times Pluto's mass, and is predominantly in the form of \~{}100 km bodies (barring a secondary peak in the mass distribution at sub-10 km sizes). The mass of Excited objects is perhaps a few times larger. (2) The Excited class has a shallower bright-end magnitude (and, presumably, size) distribution; the largest objects, including Pluto, make up tens of percent of the total mass whereas the largest CKB objects are only \~{}2\% of its mass. (3) The derived size distributions predict that the largest Excited body should be roughly the mass of Pluto, and the largest CKB body should have mR\~{}20-hence, Pluto is feasibly considered to have originated from the same physical process as the Excited TNOs. (4) The observed deficit of small TNOs occurs in the size regime where present-day collisions are expected to be disruptive, suggesting extensive depletion by collisions. The Excited and CKB size distributions are qualitatively similar to some numerical models of growth and erosion, with both accretion and erosion appearing to have proceeded to more advanced stages in the Excited class than in the CKB. (5) The lack of detections of distant TNOs implies that if a mass of TNOs comparable to the CKB is present near the invariable plane beyond 50 AU, that distant population must be composed primarily of bodies smaller than \~{}40 km. (6) There are too few small CKB objects for this population to be the reservoir of Jupiter-family comet precursors without a significant upturn in the population at diameters under 20 km. With optimistic model parameters and extrapolations, the Excited population could be the source reservoir. Implications of these discoveries for the formation and evolution of the outer solar system are discussed.

abstract = {A distinctive feature of the irregular moons of the giant planets is their orbital grouping. Previously, the prograde and retrograde groups of irregular moons at Jupiter were believed to be groups of fragments produced by the disruption of two large moons. More recently, we have shown that the retrograde group has not one but probably four or more parent bodies. We also found that fragments were launched from two of the four identified parent moons, producing two clusters of irregular moons with members of each group having similar orbits. Named the Ananke and Carme families, these two groups consist of seven and nine known member moons, respectively. The origin of this orbital clustering is unknown. Current rates of collisions among satellites in the retrograde group are too low to explain them. Collisions with cometary impactors are even less likely. Groups of irregular satellites with similar inclinations at Saturn are also yet to be explained. It is conceivable that the satellite families are remnants from early epochs of solar system formation when impactors were more numerous. In this paper we investigate the possibility that satellite families formed via collisions between large parent moons and stray planetesimals. We find that the Ananke and Carme families at Jupiter could indeed have been produced by this mechanism, unless the residual disk of planetesimals in heliocentric orbit was already severely depleted when the irregular satellites formed. Conversely, we find that formation of the Himalia group of prograde Jovian satellites by the same mechanism is unlikely unless a massive residual planetesimal disk was still present when the progenitor moon of the Himalia group was captured. We place constraints on the mass of the residual disk (1) when satellites were captured, and (2) when the Ananke and Carme families formed. These values depend sensitively on the assumed size-frequency distribution of planetesimals.},

abstract = {The Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES)-a search optimized for the discovery$\backslash$nof Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with the Blanco and Mayall 4 m telescopes$\backslash$nat the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and Kitt Peak National$\backslash$nObservatory-has covered 550 deg2 from its inception in 1998 through$\backslash$nthe end of 2003. This survey has a mean 50\% sensitivity at VR magnitude$\backslash$n22.5. We report here the discoveries of 320 designated KBOs and Centaurs$\backslash$nfor the period 2000 March through 2003 December and describe improvements$\backslash$nto our discovery and recovery procedures. Our data and the data products$\backslash$nneeded to reproduce our analyses in this paper are available through$\backslash$nthe NOAO survey database. Here we present a dynamical classification$\backslash$nscheme, based on the behavior of orbital integrations over 10 Myr.$\backslash$nThe dynamical classes, in order of testing, are ``Resonant,'' ``Centaur,''$\backslash$n``Scattered-Near,'' ``Scattered-Extended,'' and ``Classical.'' (These$\backslash$nterms are capitalized when referring to our rigorous definitions.)$\backslash$nOf the 382 total designated KBOs discovered by the DES, a subset$\backslash$nof 196 objects have sufficiently accurate orbits for dynamical classification.$\backslash$nSummary information is given for an additional 240 undesignated objects$\backslash$nalso discovered by the DES from its inception through the end of$\backslash$n2003. The number of classified DES objects (uncorrected for observational$\backslash$nbias) are Classical, 96; Resonant, 54; Scattered-Near, 24; Scattered-Extended,$\backslash$n9; and Centaur, 13. We use subsets of the DES objects (which can$\backslash$nhave observational biases removed) and larger samples to perform$\backslash$ndynamical analyses on the Kuiper belt. The first of these is a determination$\backslash$nof the Kuiper belt plane (KBP), for which the Classical objects with$\backslash$ninclinations less than 5° from the mean orbit pole yield a pole at$\backslash$nR.A.=273.92d+/-0.62d and decl.=66.70d+/-0.20d (J2000), consistent$\backslash$nwith the invariable plane of the solar system. A general method for$\backslash$nremoving observational biases from the DES data set is presented$\backslash$nand used to find a provisional magnitude distribution and the distribution$\backslash$nof orbital inclinations relative to the KBP. A power-law model fit$\backslash$nto the cumulative magnitude distribution of all KBOs discovered by$\backslash$nthe DES in the VR filter yields an index of 0.86+/-0.10 (with the$\backslash$nefficiency parameters for the DES fitted simultaneously with the$\backslash$npopulation power law). With the DES sensitivity parameters fixed,$\backslash$nwe derive power-law indices of 0.74+/-0.05, 0.52+/-0.08, and 0.74+/-0.15,$\backslash$nrespectively, for the Classical, Resonant, and Scattered classes.$\backslash$nPlans for calibration of the DES detection efficiency function and$\backslash$nDES magnitudes are discussed. The inclination distribution confirms$\backslash$nthe presence of ``hot'' and ``cold'' populations; when the geometric$\backslash$nsini factor is removed from the inclination distribution function,$\backslash$nthe cold population shows a concentrated ``core'' with a full width$\backslash$nat half-maximum of approximately 4.6d, while the hot population appears$\backslash$nas a ``halo,'' extending beyond 30°. The inclination distribution$\backslash$nis used to infer the KBO distribution in the sky, as a function of$\backslash$nlatitude relative to the KBP. This inferred latitude distribution$\backslash$nis reasonably consistent with the latitude distribution derived from$\backslash$ndirect observation, but the agreement is not perfect. We find no$\backslash$nclear boundary between the Classical and Scattered classes either$\backslash$nin their orbital inclinations with respect to the KBP or in their$\backslash$npower-law indices in their respective magnitude distributions. This$\backslash$nleaves open the possibility that common processes have shaped the$\backslash$ndistribution of orbital parameters for the two classes.},

abstract = {Granitoid gneisses and supracrustal rocks that are 3,800-4,000Myr old are the oldest recognized exposures of continental crust. To obtain insight into conditions at the Earth's surface more than 4Gyr ago requires the analysis of yet older rocks or their mineral remnants. Such an opportunity is presented by detrital zircons more than 4Gyr old found within 3-Gyr-old quartzitic rocks in the Murchison District of Western Australia. Here we report in situ U-Pb and oxygen isotope results for such zircons that place constraints on the age and composition of their sources and may therefore provide information about the nature of the Earth's early surface. We find that 3,910-4,280Myr old zircons have oxygen isotope ($\delta$18O) values ranging from 5.4 +/- 0.6‰ to 15.0 +/- 0.4‰. On the basis of these results, we postulate that the \~{}4,300-Myr-old zircons formed from magmas containing a significant component of re-worked continental crust that formed in the presence of water near the Earth's surface. These data are therefore consistent with the presence of a hydrosphere interacting with the crust by 4,300Myr ago.},

@article{Marzari2002,
abstract = {The regions around the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points of Jupiter are populated by two large swarms of asteroids called the Trojans. They may be as numerous as the main-belt asteroids and their dynamics is peculiar, involving a 1:1 resonance with Jupiter. Their origin probably dates back to the formation of Jupiter: the Trojan precursors were planetesimals orbiting close to the growing planet. Different mechanisms, including the mass growth of Jupiter, collisional diffusion, and gas drag friction, contributed to the capture of planetesimals in stable Trojan orbits before the final dispersal. The subsequent evolution of Trojan asteroids is the outcome of the joint action of different physical processes involving dynamical diffusion and excitation and collisional evolution. As a result, the present population is possibly different in both orbital and size distribution from the primordial one. No other significant population of Trojan asteroids have been found so far around other planets, apart from six Trojans of Mars, whose origin and evolution are probably very different from the Trojans of Jupiter.},

abstract = {The growth and orbital evolution of a swarm of ∼1026-g “planetary embryos,” originally distributed throughout both the terrestrial planet and the asteroidal regions has been simulated using a Monte Carlo technique previously used by the author to study the formation of the terrestrial planets alone. The effects of the giant planets, primarily Jupiter, are simply assumed to be those operative at present: chaotic acceleration in resonance regions and gravitational ejection of objects by encounters with Jupiter at aphelia ≳4.75 AU. It is found that the asteroidal embryos are very effective in scattering one another into resonance regions. The resulting orbital evolution clears the asteroid belt of embryos in about half of the simulations. Embryos accumulate in the terrestrial planet region to form a stochastically determined variety of planetary configurations that are similar in total mass, specific energy, specific angular momentum, planetary size, and orbital elements to our Solar System. The small quantity of material remaining in the asteroid region has a velocity distribution very much like that of the observed asteroids. It is concluded that this model, although certainly imperfect, represents a viable alternative to models in which the initial asteroidal population is limited to bodies the size of the present asteroids.},

The crossing of mutual mean motion resonances by the planets would excite their orbital eccentricities but not their orbital inclinations.Moreover, the amplitudes of the eigenmodes characterising the current secular evolution of the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn would not be reproduced correctly, and only one eigenmode is excited by resonance-crossing. We show that, at the very least, encounters between Saturn and one of the ice giants (Uranus or Neptune) need to have occurred to reproduce the current secular properties of the giant planets, in particular the amplitude of the two strongest eigenmodes in the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn.},

@misc{Bottke2005,
abstract = {Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g., sweeping resonances, excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size distribution over Solar System history using a collisional evolution model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption scaling law QD*. In contrast to previous efforts, we find our derived QD* function is very similar to results produced by numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state approximately 3.9-4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a "fossil" from this violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D ≳ 120 km asteroids are primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and lightcurve distributions near D ∼ 100 - 120 km are likely to be a byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on our results imply the primordial main belt population (in the form of D < 1000 km bodies) was 150-250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent dynamical simulations. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Beauge2007,
abstract = {We present results of an analytical study of proper elements and secular resonances for the irregular satellites of the outer planets. In the case of the Jovian system we identify three satellite families, two of them previously known (Carme and Ananke), plus a new agglomeration of four bodies that includes Pasiphae as its largest member. While the distribution of proper elements for Saturn's moons seems to be more random, a small cluster was found for the direct moons formed by Albiorix, Erriapo, and 2004 S1, slightly different from the so-called Gaulish cluster. No significant families are detected in the present study for the Uranian or Neptunian satellite systems. For each satellite system we determine the location of several secular resonances in the proper element space. Apart from the well-known resonance locks of Pasiphae, Sinope, and Siarnaq, a comparison between the resonance locations and proper elements shows that Saturn's satellite Narvi also exhibits temporary librations in the - ⊙ resonance. However, unlike the resonant Jovian moons that are located in the same configuration, Narvi's critical argument librates alternately around values near 90° and 270°. Neither the Uranian nor Neptunian systems seem to have resonant moons. The resonant dynamics of the real satellites in the vicinity of - ⊙ = 0 is studied with a simple model for secular resonances based on the restricted three-body problem. Depending on the initial conditions, we show the existence of one or two modes of libration that can occur at different values of the critical angle, showing a good correspondence with the observed behavior of all the resonant moons. Finally, we discuss the global distribution of the real satellites with respect to the secular resonances, as compared with synthetic populations of bodies drawn solely from stability conditions. For Saturn, we find that the present satellite population appears compatible with simple random distributions. Although the same is noted for most of the retrograde moons at Jupiter, the existence of Pasiphae and Sinope so close to resonance lock seems statistically improbable. Thus, there is a strong indication that some kind of past smooth migration occurred in the Jupiter system (but not at Saturn), which may have caused a slow evolution of its satellite population toward their present sites.},

abstract = {We explore the origin and orbital evolution of the Kuiper belt in the framework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets, sometimes known as the Nice model. This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to \~{}35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. Assuming that the last encounter with Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of \~{}27 AU and an eccentricity of \~{}0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's eccentricity damped in \~{}1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.},

@article{Hahn1999a,
abstract = {The existence of the Oort comet cloud, the Kuiper belt, and plausible inefficiencies in planetary core formation all suggest that there was once a residual planetesimal disk of mass \~{}10–100 M⊕ in the vicinity of the giant planets following their formation. Since removal of this disk requires an exchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets, significant planetary migration can ensue. The planet migration phenomenon is examined numerically by evolving the orbits of the giant planets while they are embedded in a planetesimal disk having a mass of MD = 10–200 M⊕. We find that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune evolve radially outward as they scatter the planetesimals, while Jupiter's orbit shrinks as it ejects mass. Higher mass disks result in more rapid and extensive planet migration. If orbital expansion and resonance trapping by Neptune are invoked to explain the eccentricities of Pluto and its cohort of Kuiper belt objects at Neptune's 3:2 mean motion resonance, then our simulations suggest that a disk mass of order MD \~{} 50 M⊕ is required to expand Neptune's orbit by $\Delta$a \~{} 7 AU, in order to pump up Plutino eccentricities to e \~{} 0.3. Such planet migration implies that the solar system was more compact in the past, with the initial Jupiter-Neptune separation having been smaller by about 30\%. We discuss the fate of the remnants of the primordial planetesimal disk. We point out that most of the planetesimal disk beyond Neptune's 2:1 resonance should reside in nearly circular, low-inclination orbits, unless there are (or were) additional, unseen, distant perturbers. The planetesimal disk is also the source of the Oort cloud of comets. Using the results of our simulations together with a simple treatment of Oort cloud dynamics, we estimate that \~{}12 M⊕ of disk material was initially deposited in the Oort cloud, of which \~{}4 M⊕ will persist over the age of the solar system. The majority of these comets originated from the Saturn-Neptune region of the solar nebula.},
