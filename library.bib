abstract = {In the recent years, the "Nice" model of solar system formation has attained an unprecedented level of success in reproducing much of the observed orbital architecture of the solar system by evolving the planets to their current locations from a more compact configuration. Within the context of this model, the formation of the classical Kuiper Belt requires a phase during which the ice giants have a high eccentricity. An outstanding question of this model is the initial configuration from which the solar system started out. Recent work has shown that multi-resonant initial conditions can serve as good candidates, as they naturally prevent vigorous type-II migration. In this paper, we use analytical arguments, as well as self-consistent numerical N-body simulations to identify fully resonant initial conditions, whose dynamical evolution is characterized by an eccentric phase of the ice giants, as well as planetary scattering. We find a total of eight such initial conditions. Four of these primordial states are compatible with the canonical "Nice" model, while the others imply slightly different evolutions. The results presented here should prove useful in further development of a comprehensive model for solar system formation.},

@article{Morbidelli2005a,
abstract = {Recent work [1][2][3] has advocated that the current structure of the Solar System can be explained if, at the end of the gas-disk phase, Jupiter and Saturn were closer to each other than their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance, namely the ratio of their orbital periods was smaller than 2. Here we show that this planetary configuration may be a natural outcome of the evolution of the planets in the gas disk. Moreover, we argue that this configuration was necessary to prevent that Type II migration brought Jupiter and Saturn much closer to the Sun. Our work extends previous results [4], by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code [5] that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in a `close' resonance (such as the 5:3, 3:2, 4:3 resonances) the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. The initial locking of the planets in a close resonance is a likely outcome if Saturn formed at the edge of Jupiter's gap. However, it is also possible if Saturn initially was beyond the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter, because the fast migration of Saturn often causes the planet to jump across this resonance.},

abstract = {The present study generalizes the mapping method of Wisdom (1982) to encompass all gravitational n-body problems with a dominant central mass. The rationale for the generalized mapping method is discussed as well as details for the mapping for the n-body problem. Some refinements of the method are considered, and the relationship of the mapping method to other symplectic integration methods is shown. The method is used to compute the evolution of the outer planets for a billion years. The resulting evolution is compared to the 845 million year evolution of the outer planets performed on the Digital Orerry using standard numerical integration techniques. This calculation provides independent numerical confirmation of the result of Sussman and Wisdom (1988) that the motion of the planet Pluto is chaotic.},

abstract = {The existence of a dominant massive planet, Jupiter, in our solar system, although perhaps essential for long-term dynamical stability and the development of life, may not be typical of planetary systems that form around other stars. In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastrom distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.},

abstract = {Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) are an ancient reservoir of comets beyond Neptune's orbit. Some of these objects were recently found to have the reddest optical colours in the Solar System, but the number of objects for which accurate colours were available was too small for any correlation to be discerned between colour and physical or dynamical properties, which might shed light on the origin of these objects. Here we report that all nine of the KBOs in our survey on near-circular (low-eccentricity) orbits with perihelion distances larger than 40 AU have extremely red surfaces, thereby connecting an observable property with a dynamical class. Of the objects with orbital eccentricities greater than 0.1, about half are also very red, while the rest have colours similar to the Sun, meaning that reflected sunlight is not strongly modified by the objects' surface properties. In addition, of the 13 'classical' KBOs (those with semimajor axis a approximately 45 AU and eccentricity e < 0.15), the ten that are very red are in orbits with small angles of inclination to the ecliptic, whereas the three with solar colours are all in high-inclination orbits. We suggest that these three 'grey' classical KBOs may be part of a dynamical group that is separate from the 'red' classical KBOs.},

abstract = {We have measured broadband optical BVR photometry of 24 classical and scattered Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), approximately doubling the published sample of colors for these classes of objects. We find a statistically significant correlation between object color and inclination in the classical Kuiper belt using our data. The color and inclination correlation increases in significance after the inclusion of additional data points culled from all published works. Apparently, this color and inclination correlation has not been more widely reported because the Plutinos show no such correlation and thus have been a major contaminant in previous samples. The color and inclination correlation excludes simple origins of color diversity, such as the presence of a coloring agent without regard to dynamical effects. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of the Kuiper belt precludes us from understanding whether the color and inclination trend is due to environmental factors, such as collisional resurfacing, or primordial population effects. A perihelion and color correlation is also evident, although this appears to be a spurious correlation induced by sampling bias, as perihelion and inclination are correlated in the observed sample of KBOs.},

abstract = {We use the current orbital structure of large (>50 km) asteroids in themain asteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when they migrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones.Minton\&Malhotra showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt can be reproduced by an exponentially decaying migration of the giant planets on a timescale of $\tau$ â¼ 0.5 Myr. However, self-consistent numerical simulations show that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is inconsistent with an exponential change in their semi-major axes on such a short timescale. In fact, the typical timescale is $\tau$ ? 5Myr.When giant planet migration on this timescale is applied to the asteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the observed one. However, the planet migration can be significantly sped up by planetâplanet encounters. Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn have close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune itself) and where this third planet, after being scattered inward by Saturn, is scattered outward by Jupiter. This scenario leads to a very rapid increase in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn which we show here to have only mild effects on the structure of the asteroid belt. This type of evolution is called a âjumping-Jupiterâ case. Our results suggest that the total mass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration were comparable to those currently observed. Moreover, they imply that, before migration, the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn were much less eccentric than their current ones. Key},

abstract = {We explore the origin and orbital evolution of the Kuiper belt in the framework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets, sometimes known as the Nice model. This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to \~{}35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. Assuming that the last encounter with Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of \~{}27 AU and an eccentricity of \~{}0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's eccentricity damped in \~{}1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.},

abstract = {We study the orbital evolution of the four giant planets of our solar system in a gas disk. Our investigation extends the previous works by Masset \& Snellgrove and Morbidelli \& Crida, which focused on the dynamics of the Jupiter-Saturn system. The only systems we found to reach a steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple mean-motion resonance (i.e., each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). In total, we found six such configurations. For the gas-disk parameters found in Morbidelli \& Crida, these configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. After the disappearance of the gas, and in the absence of planetesimals, only two of these six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time of hundreds of millions of years or more. The others become unstable on a timescale of a few Myr. Our preliminary simulations show that, when a planetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, the planets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to their current orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in Tsiganis et al.},

abstract = {Models of the evolution of Neptune's migration and the dynamical processes at work during the formation of the outer solar system can be constrained by measuring the orbital distribution of the remnant planetesimals in the Kuiper belt. Determining the true orbit distribution is not simple because the detection and tracking of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) is a highly biased process. In this chapter we examine the various biases that are present in any survey of the Kuiper belt. We then present observational and analysis strategies that can help to minimize the effects of these biases on the inferred orbital distributions. We find that material currently classified as the classical Kuiper belt is well represented by two subpopulations: a high-inclination component that spans and uniformly fills the stable phase space between 30 and 47 AU combined with a low-inclination, low-eccentricity population enhancement between 42 and 45 AU. The low-i, low-e component may be that which has long been called the "Kuiper belt." We also find weaker evidence that the high-i component of the classical Kuiper belt may extend beyond the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. The scattering/detached disk appears to extend to larger semimajor axis with no evidence for a falloff steeper than r-1. This population is likely at least as large as the classical Kuiper belt population and has an i/e distribution much like that of the hot classical Kuiper belt. We also find that the fraction of objects in the 3:2 resonance is likely around 20\% and previous estimates that place this population at \~{}5\% are inconsistent with present observations. Additionally, high-order mean-motion resonances play a substantial role in the structure of the Kuiper belt.},

abstract = {We study the influence of an open cluster environment on the formation and current structure of the Oort cloud. To do this, we have run 19 different simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud for 4.5 Gyrs. In each simulation, the Solar System spends its first 100 Myrs in a different open cluster environment before transitioning to its current field environment. We find that, compared to forming in the field environment, the inner Oort cloud is preferentially loaded with comets while the Sun resides in the open cluster and that most of this material remains locked in the interior of the cloud for the next 4.4 Gyrs. In addition, the outer Oort cloud trapping efficiencies we observe in our simulations are lower than previous formation models by about a factor of 2, possibly implying an even more massive early planetesimal disk. Furthermore, some of our simulations reproduce the orbits of observed extended scattered disk objects, which may serve as an observational constraint on the Sun's early environment. Depending on the particular open cluster environment, the properties of the inner Oort cloud and extended scattered disk can vary widely. On the other hand, the outer portions of the Oort cloud in each of our simulations are all similar.},

abstract = {Most highland total rock samples define a single Usingle bondPb isochron which corresponds to a metamorphism age of â¼ 3.9AE. This age is also obtained for internal Usingle bondPb isochrons for some of these samples. The data on 18 rock samples range from concordant samples with238U/206Pbâ¼ 1.2 to discordant ones with238U/206Pbâ¼ 0.02. This feature coupled with a correlated pattern of 238U/204Pb ratios, indicates that Pb was extensively mobilized at â¼ 3.9AE. The observed Pbsingle bondU fractionation is essentially due to Pb volatilization during the metamorphic events. Volatile Pb transport is not accompanied by similar effects in Rb and must therefore be attributed to a specific process. Rbsingle bondSr internal isochrons for the same rocks determine distinct metamorphic events in the interval 3.85â4.00 AE. We conclude that highland samples from widely separated areas bear the imprint of an event or series of events in a narrow time interval which can be identified with a cataclysmic impacting rate of the moon at â¼ 3.9AE, although differentiation by internal magma generation cannot be excluded. This cataclysm is associated with the Imbrium impact and very possibly the formation of Crisium and Orientale and possibly several other major basins in a narrow time interval (â¼2 Ã 108yr or less). The Usingle bondPb data indicate formation of the lunar crust at â¼ 4.4AE, which is distinctly younger than 4.6 AE, the time generally associated with planetary formation. If the lunar crust started being formed at â¼ 4.6AE, then this process must have continued until times significantly younger than 4.4 AE. Rbsingle bondSr data also indicate formation of the lunar crust around 4.5 AE with only minor additions of high Rb/Sr materials to the crust at times younger than 4.3 AE. Using the Usingle bondPb systematics, K/U and the average U concentration of the moon as obtained from heat-flow measurements, we estimate the lunar concentrations: primordial Pb= 35ppb;Rb= 0.5ppm with Rb/Sr= 0.006.},

abstract = {In the primordial Solar System the most plausible sources of the water accreted by the Earth were in the outer asteroid belt, in the giant planet regions and in the Kuiper belt. We investigate the implications on the origin of Earth's water of dynamical models of primordial evolution of solar system bodies and check them with respect to chemical constraints. We find that it is plausible that the Earth accreted water all along its formation, from the early phases when the solar nebula was still present to the late stages of gas-free sweepup of scattered planetesimals. Asteroids and the comets from the Jupiter-Saturn region were the first water deliverers, when the Earth was less than half its present mass. The bulk of the water presently on Earth was carried by a few planetary embryos, originally formed in the outer asteroid belt and accreted by the Earth at the final stage of its formation. Finally, a late veneer, accounting for at most 10\% of the present water mass, occurred due to comets from the Uranus-Neptune region and from the Kuiper belt. The net result of accretion from these several reservoirs is that the water on Earth had essentially the D/H ratio typical of the water condensed in the outer asteroid belt. This is in agreement with the observation that the D/H ratio in the oceans is very close to the mean value of the D/H ratio of the water inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites.},
