abstract = {We explore the origin and orbital evolution of the Kuiper belt in the framework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets, sometimes known as the Nice model. This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to \~{}35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. Assuming that the last encounter with Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of \~{}27 AU and an eccentricity of \~{}0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's eccentricity damped in \~{}1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.},

abstract = {The existence of the Oort Comet Cloud, the Kuiper Belt, and plausible inefficiencies in planetary core formation, all suggest that there was once a residual planetesimal disk of mass 10-100 Earth-masses in the vicinity of the giant planets following their formation. Since removal of this disk requires an exchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets, significant planetary migration can ensue. The planet migration phenomenon is examined numerically by evolving the orbits of the giant planets while they are embedded in a planetesimal disk having a mass of M\_d=10 to 200 Earth-masses. We find that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune evolve radially outwards as they scatter the planetesimals, while Jupiter's orbit shrinks as it ejects mass. Higher-mass disks result in more rapid and extensive planet migration. If orbit expansion and resonance trapping by Neptune is invoked to explain the eccentricities of Pluto and its cohort of Kuiper Belt Objects at Neptune's 3:2 mean-motion resonance, then our simulations suggest that a disk mass of order M\_d\~{}50 Earth-masses is required to expand Neptune's orbit by \~{}7 AU in order to pump up Plutino eccentricities to e\~{}0.3. Such planet migration implies that the initial Solar System was more compact in the past, with the Jupiter-Neptune separation having been smaller by about 30\%. The planetesimal disk is also the source of the Oort Cloud of comets. Using the results of our simulations together with a simple treatment of Oort Cloud dynamics, we estimate that \~{}12 Earth-masses of disk material was initially deposited in the Oort Cloud, of which \~{}4 Earth-masses will persist over the age of the Solar System. The majority of these comets originated from the Saturn-Neptune region of the solar nebula.},

abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (Haisch et al. 2001) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only \~{}100,000 years (Armitage 2007). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration (Masset \& Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli \& Crida 2007, Pierens \& Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

abstract = {Recent studies of solar system formation suggest that the solar system's giant planets formed and migrated in the protoplanetary disk to reach resonant orbits with all planets inside 15 AU from the Sun. After the gas disk's dispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and approached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of planetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the Kuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase between giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are plausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant system of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present orbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the terrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with fewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a relatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the statistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system initially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This possibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a large number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that planet ejection should be common.},

abstract = {Jupiter's Trojans are asteroids that follow essentially the same orbit as Jupiter, but lead or trail the planet by an angular distance of approximately 60 degrees (co-orbital motion). They are hypothesized to be planetesimals that formed near Jupiter and were captured onto their current orbits while Jupiter was growing, possibly with the help of gas drag and/or collisions. This idea, however, cannot explain some basic properties of the Trojan population, in particular its broad orbital inclination distribution, which ranges up to approximately 40 degrees (ref. 8). Here we show that the Trojans could have formed in more distant regions and been subsequently captured into co-orbital motion with Jupiter during the time when the giant planets migrated by removing neighbouring planetesimals. The capture was possible during a short period of time, just after Jupiter and Saturn crossed their mutual 1:2 resonance, when the dynamics of the Trojan region were completely chaotic. Our simulations of this process satisfactorily reproduce the orbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass.},

In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals.

The new LROC image data show that the Sculptured Hills in the Taurus highlands is Imbrium ejecta and not directly related to the formation of the Serenitatis basin. This occurrence and the geological relations of this unit suggests that the Apollo 17 impact melts may not be not samples of the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, leaving their provenance undetermined and origin unexplained. If the Apollo 17 melt rocks are Serenitatis impact melt, up to half of the basin and large crater population of the Moon was created within a 30 Ma interval around 3.8 Ga in a global impact “cataclysm.” Either interpretation significantly changes our view of the impact process and history of the Earth-Moon system.},

abstract = {Several properties of the Solar System, including the wide radial spacing and orbital eccentricities of giant planets, can be explained if the early Solar System evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planets in the planetesimal disk. Here we report the results of a statistical study, in which we performed nearly 10\^{}4 numerical simulations of planetary instability starting from hundreds of different initial conditions. We found that the dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the Solar System. Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk of planetesimals was large (M\_disk>50 M\_Earth), but we found that a massive disk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e\_55 < 0.01 compared to present e\_55=0.044, where e\_55 is the amplitude of the fifth eccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates constraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were obtained when the Solar System was assumed to have five giant planets initially and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected into interstellar space by Jupiter. The best results were obtained when the ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance with Saturn and M\_disk \~{} 20 M\_Earth. The range of possible outcomes is rather broad in this case, indicating that the present Solar System is neither a typical nor expected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with only a \~{}5\% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the main text). The case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but does offer significant advantages relative to the five planet case.},

abstract = {The petrology record on the Moon suggests that a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred approximately 700 million years after the planets formed; this event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Planetary formation theories cannot naturally account for an intense period of planetesimal bombardment so late in Solar System history. Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the observational constraints of the outer Solar System.},

This magnitude corresponds to objects that are about 7 km in radius (assuming an albedo of 0.04). We detected (without prior knowledge of their positions) all previously known outer satellites and discovered two new irregular satellites (S/2001 U2 and S/2003 U3). The two inner satellites Titania and Oberon were also detected. One of the newly discovered satellites (S/2003 U3) is the first known irregular prograde of the planet. The population, size distribution and orbital parameters of Uranus' irregular satellites are remarkably similar to the irregular satellites of gas giant Jupiter. Both have shallow size distributions (power law indices q\~{}2 for radii > 7 km) with no correlation between the sizes of the satellites and their orbital parameters. However, unlike those of Jupiter, Uranus' irregular satellites do not appear to occupy tight distinct dynamical groups in semi-major axis versus inclination phase space. Two groupings in semi-major axis versus eccentricity phase space appear to be statistically significant.},

abstract = {Recent work [1][2][3] has advocated that the current structure of the Solar System can be explained if, at the end of the gas-disk phase, Jupiter and Saturn were closer to each other than their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance, namely the ratio of their orbital periods was smaller than 2. Here we show that this planetary configuration may be a natural outcome of the evolution of the planets in the gas disk. Moreover, we argue that this configuration was necessary to prevent that Type II migration brought Jupiter and Saturn much closer to the Sun. Our work extends previous results [4], by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code [5] that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in a `close' resonance (such as the 5:3, 3:2, 4:3 resonances) the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. The initial locking of the planets in a close resonance is a likely outcome if Saturn formed at the edge of Jupiter's gap. However, it is also possible if Saturn initially was beyond the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter, because the fast migration of Saturn often causes the planet to jump across this resonance.},
